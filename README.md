# FluidSimulator
A FluidSimulator I began when I did my technological watch. I didn't finish it then, but I haven't give up on it, and will continue to implement it.

## Actually

I re-did the project setup because of some issues with the files, where I couldn't have multiple files because the link editing wouldn't work. Now, it is.
Next thing is working on the calcul part, where I left off in my technological watch.
